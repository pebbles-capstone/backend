### Overview
This is part of UofT's Engineering Capstone design course. Our project Pebbles aims to help improve the capstone
experience by creating curated recommendations on potential teammates, professors and project ideas. These recommendations
will be generated by using a tinder like experience where students can swipe throught past projects which allows us to collect
implicit interests. These intereses will be collected as a feature vector which will be cluster with other students, professors and past projects. Once clusters are formed, we perform K-nearest neighbors to find the best matches for each category of recommendations.
